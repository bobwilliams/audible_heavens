## So, what is this?

Are you still struggling with the scale of the universe?  Still having a hard time realizing the vastness of space and the size of celestial objects?

If so, Audible Heavens gives you a new way to explore the universe.

By using sounds, Audible Heavens provides another and meaningful way to understand things such as how bring a star is, how fast it is moving in relational to cosmic expansion, or even it's spatial relationtional to say the Sun.

_As a note: this project is very much in an alpha phase._
